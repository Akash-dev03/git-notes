### üì¶ Stash Naming (Optional but Handy)

Sometimes you're mid-way through changes, but need to:
* Switch branches
* Pull latest changes
* Test something quickly
‚Ä¶but you're **not ready to commit** yet. That‚Äôs where `git stash` comes in!
### üß† What Is Git Stash?
`git stash` temporarily shelves (or stashes) **modified tracked files** so you can work on something else, and then come back to them later.
##  Common Use Cases
* You're halfway coding a feature but need to checkout another branch
* You're waiting for a code review but want to test a bugfix
### Basic Stash Workflow
1. Save your changes:
```
git stash
```
2. View your stash list:
```
git stash list
```
3. Apply the last stashed work:
```
git stash apply
```
